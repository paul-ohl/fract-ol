# Fract-ol

A [42](https://42.fr/) project in which the goal is to use a small C graphics
library (created by the school) to generate and display multiple fractals.

The user has to be able to navigate the fractal and, of course, zoom into it.

## Installation

On linux: just run `make test`, it will launch the program automatically once it
has built.

On MacOS: [follow instructions here](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)
and then run `make test`.
